# DuckTales

If you can explain it to the rubber duck, you’ve already debugged it.


# 🐤 DuckTales

> *“Life is like a bug-fix, here in DuckTales!”*

Welcome to **DuckTales** — a whimsical dev journal where every bug has a backstory, and every commit begins with a conversation (with a duck, obviously).

This repo is a space for:
- 🧠 Explaining code to myself out loud (a.k.a. the duck)
- 🧪 Experimenting with ideas, scripts, and weird workflows
- 💭 Turning confusion into clarity — one tale at a time

---

## 🛠️ Work in Progress

This is just the beginning.  
As I build, learn, and debug, folders and stories will be added here.

Stay tuned for:
- `logs/` of rubberduck rants
- `playground/` experiments that may or may not work
- `snippets/` of reusable code worth revisiting

## 🧠 Final Thought

Rubberducking is real.  
It’s not weird. You’re not weird.  
You're just having a conversation with your most judgment-free debugging partner. 🐥
